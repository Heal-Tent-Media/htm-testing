            <p>While using Our Service, We may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information
                that can be used to contact or identify you.</p>
            <h4 class="pp-i">Usage Data</h4>
            <p><b>In Short:</b> Some information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device
                characteristics is collected automatically when you visit our Website.</p>
            <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Website. This
                information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may
                include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics,
                operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
                about how and when you use our Website and other technical information. This information is primarily
                needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website, and for our internal analytics and
                reporting purposes.</p>
            <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>

            <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Log and Usage Data.</b> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage and performance
                    information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Website and which we record
                    in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address,
                    device information, browser type and settings and information about your activity in the Website
                    (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other
                    actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity,
                    error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware settings).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Device Data.</b> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet or
                    other device you use to access the Website. Depending on the device used, this device data may
                    include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification
                    numbers, location, browser type, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier,
                    operating system and system configuration information.
                </li>

                <li><b>Location Data.</b> We collect location data such as information about your device's location,
                    which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
                    settings of the device you use to access the Website. For example, we may use GPS and other
                    technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                    address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to
                    the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to
                    opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
